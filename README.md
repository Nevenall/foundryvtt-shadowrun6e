# A FoundryVTT System Module for Shadowrun 6th World

**This system is officially abandoned in favor of https://bitbucket.org/rpgframework-cloud/shadowrun6-eden/src/master/**

This system module implements Shadowrun 6th Worldâ€‹ (edition) for FoundryVTT. 

Although technically a fork of https://github.com/smilligan93/SR5-FoundryVTT this system starts from the groundup. 

## What's Currently Working

- Character attributes and skills
- Common dice pools are calculated and rollable *shift click for roll options*
- Condition tracking with penalties
- Character Journal entries can be added in markdown
- Rolls in chat display hits and will calculate glitches


## We are Actively Looking for Maintainers

This system is up for adoption. Create an issue https://github.com/Nevenall/foundry-shadowrun6e/issues if you're interested.
